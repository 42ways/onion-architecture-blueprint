# Java Architecture Playground

This repo is just for some experiments in Java Software Architecture Patterns.

## Usage
The module `main` includes some demo programs that can be started by running
the main methods from within IntelliJ or directly on the command line.

After compilation you can use e.g.
```java -cp out/production/core:out/production/application:out/production/infrastructure:out/production/main:lib/* de.fourtytwoways.onion.PersonDemo```
or
```java -cp out/production/core:out/production/application:out/production/infrastructure:out/production/main:lib/* de.fourtytwoways.onion.EnumDemo```
to run the demo/test programs.
